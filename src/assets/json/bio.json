    "about": [
        "I started programing at 15 years old when I wanted to learn how to make a discord bot to show off to my friends. I went on youtube and learned how to make a discord bot in javascript. Despite my first bot having many issues due to my poor knowledge of javascript and no knowledge of data structures, I was hooked.",
        "I'm currently working towards my bachelor's to see where I stand amongst CS majors and to push myself beyond my current limits as a software developer. My goal is to graduate by 2025 with my degree and might pursue a master's afterward.",
        "Besides programming, I like to play strategy games and make memes/videos for others to enjoy. I also make spread sheets as well with some backend code implemented thxs to Google App Script."
