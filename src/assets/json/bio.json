    "about": [
        "I started programing at 15 years old when I wanted to learn how to make a discord bot to show off to my friends. I went on youtube and learned how to make a discord bot in javascript. Despite my first bot having many issues due to my lack of knowledge of data structures and general programming etiquette, I really enjoyed programming.",
        "I'm currently working towards my bachelor's not only to see where I stand amongst other computer science majors, but to push myself to the limits",
        "Besides programming, I like to play strategy games based on history/fiction and playing online games with friends."
